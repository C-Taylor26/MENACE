# MENACE
A remake of the matchbox naughts and crosses machine, M.E.N.A.C.E

Learns by keeping track of what moves have resulted in a win in the past and wha moves have resulted in a loss. 
A move is selected based on this prvious data.

Each move is given a vaule of 0. If the move is used and results in a win then that vaule is raised. If it results in a loss then the value is lowered.
